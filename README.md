# Homeworks
Rules:
- Soft and Hard deadlines
- 2 weeks from the start before the soft deadline
- 1 additional week after the soft deadline before the hard deadline
- Penalty 10% to the grade for each day after soft deadline
- 4 late days in total. You can use up to all 4 in a single assignment
- Late days can be used to prolong either soft or hard deadline
- State within the assignment that you are using late day. It must be clear to the person evaluating it.

### HW's list:
#### Practical:

- [__HW1__](./homeworks/practical/hw1)
    - Graded 10 pts maximum 
    - Soft deadline: 18.03.24, 15.00
    - Hard deadline: 25.03.24, 15.00
    - You lose 10% off your grade daily after the soft deadline.
    - You have 4 late days to mitigate this penalty. It could be used either towards the soft or the hard deadlines.
- [__HW2__](./homeworks/practical/hw2)
